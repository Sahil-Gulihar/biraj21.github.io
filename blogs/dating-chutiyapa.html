    <h1>welcome to the desert, aka my dating life</h1>

    <p>
      so you swiped right, eh? not yet probably. but since you're here, clearly your standards aren't as high as Burj
      Khalifa. but hey, who am i to judge?
    </p>

    <h2>here's the lowdown on me:</h2>

    <li>a chess amateur who barely knows how to move a knight without tripping over my own pieces</li>
    <li>i like Sherlock Holmes, but only the books because BBC Sherlock is an overrated garbage</li>
    <li>sometimes i get lost in manhwa (look it up, it's worth it)</li>
    <li>
      then there's this typical dark humour, love for anime, etc. etc., but i don't make that my entire personality
    </li>

    <p>my humor? ehh it's kinda questionable but you're still reading, so maybe there's hope. here's an example:</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://x.com/not_salgaonkar/status/1795810862684647849">
      whenever someone calls me sweet, i just think of it as a euphemism for "your d*ick's the size of a candy" (it may
      or may not be true)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      let's keep it real: i'm all about that tit for tat. you want casual? ehh alright. looking for something long-term?
      i'm absolutely in. just be upfront about what you want, and we'll get along just fine. situationships wale bkl
      mere se dur rahe! this is important so i'll repeat it:
    </p>

    <blockquote cite=".">situationships wale bkl mere se dur rahe!</blockquote>

    <p>
      now that you know a bit about me, what's your story? if you think you can keep up with <strong>this</strong> drop
      me a message. who knows, maybe we'll be the next big thing since peanut butter and jelly. or at least have a few
      laughs along the way.
